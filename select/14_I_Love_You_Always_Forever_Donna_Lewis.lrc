[00:02.69] Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
[00:09.75] Of light mists with pale amber rose
[00:18.41] Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
[00:29.09] Touching, discovering you
[00:41.59] 
[00:47.15] Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
[00:56.02] Miles of windless summer nights (Summer nights)
[01:05.23] Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
[01:14.54] Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
[01:22.98] Say it, say it again
[01:25.04] I love you always forever
[01:37.54] 
[01:26.68] Near or far, closer together
[01:28.94] Everywhere I will be with you

[01:45.26] The most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
[01:51.05] You've got...
[01:54.75] Me almost melting away
[01:59.60] As we lay there
[02:04.06] Under a blue sky with pure white stars
[02:10.00] Exotic sweetness
[02:13.59] A magical time
[02:20.59] 
[02:18.47] Say it, say it again
[02:20.38] I love you always forever
