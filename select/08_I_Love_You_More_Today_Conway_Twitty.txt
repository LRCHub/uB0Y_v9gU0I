I want you more than anything in the world
You mean more to me than any other girl
Now he's with you and things you do with him
We've done them for so long
I love you more today, than he can from now on.

I've kissed your tears away when you were sad
Held you close, felt your warm love when you were glad
So, no matter how much love he has for you or how long
I love you more today, than he can from now on.

We've already done the things he plans to do
So don't be surprised if late at night
I'm in your dreams with you.
And if someday his love for goes wrong
I love you more today, than he can from now on.

I love you more today, than he can from now on...
