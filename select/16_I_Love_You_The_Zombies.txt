I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
But the words won't come and I don't know what to say

I should tell you, I love you, I do
My words should explain, but my words won't come
I shouldn't hide my love deep inside
My words should explain, but my words won't come
I should tell you just how I feel and I keep tryin'
But something holds me back when I try to tell you

I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
But the words won't come and I don't know what to say

If I can find the words in my mind
The words could explain, but the words won't come
If you can see what you mean to me
My words should explain, but my words won't come
And oh, how hard I try to tell you I love you
But something holds me back when I try to tell you

I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
But the words won't come and I don't know what to say
Lord

And I don't know what to say
And oh, how hard I try to tell you I love you
But something holds me back when I try to tell you

I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
But the words won't come and I don't know what to say
Lord

(I love you) I love you
(I love you) Love you
(I love you) Love you oh
(Yes I do) I love you
(I love you) I love you
(I love you) I love you
(I love you) I love you
(Yes I do) Whoa oh oh
